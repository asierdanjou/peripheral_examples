period_measurement_polled

This readme applies for the Gecko device.

This project demonstrates polled period measurement using the TIMER module.
TIMER0 is initialized for input capture on Compare/Capture channel 0 for 
falling edge capture. GPIO Pin PD1 (Expansion Header Pin 6) is to be connected
to a periodic signal, and edges captured from PD1 are stored in CC0. The 
program waits until an edge is available. Then the captured edge is read from
CC0 and compared with the previously captured edge to calculate the period. 
The measured period is stored in a global variable.

How To Test:
1. Build the project and download to the Starter Kit
2. Connect a periodic signal to GPIO Pin PD1 (Expansion Header Pin 6)
3. View the measured_period global variable in the debugger

NOTE: The range of frequencies this program can measure accurately is limited.
The minimum measurable period is around 3 microseconds, or 333 kHz. At higher
frequencies accuracy is diminished due to dropout, and above 333 kHz the loop
execution time is longer than the signal period. For methods to measure shorter
periods, see the pulse_capture example.
